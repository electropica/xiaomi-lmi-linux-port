# Mobian M0 status

## M0 BASE — validated on hardware

Validated on Xiaomi `lmi` hardware with the downstream D-v43 kernel.

Confirmed:

- Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie)
- systemd as PID 1
- root filesystem on `/dev/loop0p2`
- USB RNDIS preserved across switch_root
- `usb0` configured as `172.16.42.1/16`
- SSH root login by public key
- kernel `4.19.325-cip128-st12-perf`

The M0 BASE image is intentionally not stored in Git.

## M0 DISPLAY — VALIDATED ON HARDWARE

Validated on Xiaomi `lmi` hardware:

- KMS continuous-splash release with Debian `modetest` works
- seatd with `SEATD_VTBOUND=0` works
- Weston 14.0.2 DRM/Pixman with kiosk shell works
- `DSI-1` drives the physical panel
- a red background is physically visible
- downstream `msm_drm` requires the tracked Weston workaround that
  de-duplicates indistinguishable formats in the legacy no-`IN_FORMATS`
  fallback

See `notes/mobian-m0-display-hardware-validation-2026-09-02.md` for the exact
experimental evidence and backend identities.

## Repository policy

Generated `.img`, `.ext4`, Android sparse images, root filesystems, private
keys, caches and other build artifacts are intentionally excluded from Git.
