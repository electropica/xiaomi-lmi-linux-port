## M0 BASE — validated on hardware

Validated on Xiaomi `lmi` hardware with the downstream D-v43 kernel.

Confirmed:

- Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie)
- systemd as PID 1
- root filesystem on `/dev/loop0p2`
- USB RNDIS preserved across switch_root
- `usb0` configured as `172.16.42.1/16`
- SSH root login by public key
- kernel `4.19.325-cip128-st12-perf`

The M0 BASE image is intentionally not stored in Git.

## M0 DISPLAY — VALIDATED ON HARDWARE

Validated on Xiaomi `lmi` hardware:

- KMS continuous-splash release with Debian `modetest` works
- seatd with `SEATD_VTBOUND=0` works
- Weston 14.0.2 DRM/Pixman with kiosk shell works
- `DSI-1` drives the physical panel
- a red background is physically visible
- downstream `msm_drm` requires the tracked Weston workaround that
  de-duplicates indistinguishable formats in the legacy no-`IN_FORMATS`
  fallback

See `notes/mobian-m0-display-hardware-validation-2026-09-02.md` for the exact
experimental evidence and backend identities.

## M1 PHOSH — VALIDATED ON HARDWARE

The M1 graphical session and basic Phosh interaction were validated on Xiaomi
`lmi` hardware. The clear-KMS marker was visible, Phoc acquired `DSI-1` with
the Pixman renderer, and the Phosh lock screen appeared. Touch input and the
swipe-up gesture worked, the passcode prompt allowed the session to be
unlocked, and the Phosh desktop was then displayed with its applications and
icons.

This milestone validates the graphical bring-up and basic Phosh interaction.
It does not validate GPU acceleration, every Phosh function, or readiness for
daily use.

## M1 WIFI — VALIDATED ON HARDWARE

Manual bring-up on `lmi` with D-v43 completed the QCA6390 CNSS/WLFW sequence,
created `wlp1s0`, scanned nearby BSS entries, associated with WPA2, obtained a
DHCP lease and default route, and preserved the independent `usb0` SSH path.
The kernel dynamically selected `bd_j11gl.elf`; it must not be overridden with
the older historical `bd_j11.elf` default.

The systemd implementation under `mobian/m1-phosh/wifi` and the integrated
Debian `wpasupplicant` are now validated on hardware in M1 REPRO v3. The image
completed firmware bring-up, `FW_READY`, qcacld probe, WLAN creation,
automatic SSID listing, CLI WPA2 association, DHCP, DNS, and Internet access
while preserving USB SSH. No Wi-Fi profile or credential is tracked. See
`notes/mobian-m1-wifi-hardware-validation-2026-09-03.md`.

## M1 REPRO v2 IMAGE — HARDWARE-TESTED / CORRECTIONS REQUIRED

The reproducible M1 Phosh/Wi-Fi rootfs and phone images were built and
validated on the host. The final ext4 has the expected `pmOS_root` label and
UUID, passes `e2fsck -fn`, and the Android sparse image round-trips bit-for-bit
to the final raw image. Package installation, service enablement, Phosh/Pixman
configuration, the AArch64 property shim, and the absence of proprietary
Android payloads in the image were checked.

This exact image subsequently booted on the phone. Its low-level systemd Wi-Fi
automation succeeded, and its Phosh/Pixman stack worked when the splash unit
was started without its stale `dev-dri-card0.device` dependency. Automatic
display startup was blocked by that inherited dependency; Wi-Fi association
needed runtime installation of `wpasupplicant`; and time synchronization
needed runtime installation of `systemd-timesyncd`. Those findings produced
the recipe corrections subsequently validated in v3. See
`notes/mobian-m1-repro-v2-hardware-validation-2026-09-04.md`.

## M1 REPRO v3 — VALIDATED ON HARDWARE

The v3 userdata image booted on Xiaomi `lmi` with D-v43 and reached Phosh
automatically without SSH intervention. The corrected splash unit has no
`dev-dri-card0.device` dependency; its bounded wait for the real character
device allowed clear-KMS, seatd, Phoc/Pixman on `DSI-1`, the lock screen, and
the unlocked Phosh desktop to start normally.

The integrated low-level QCA6390 automation and `wpasupplicant 2:2.10-24`
provided WLAN discovery, scanning, CLI WPA2 association, DHCP, routing, DNS,
and Internet access. Integrated `systemd-timesyncd 257.13-1~deb13u1`
synchronized the system clock after networking became available; this does
not repair the incorrect hardware RTC.

After the v3 image validation, a clean runtime experiment additionally
validated `PAMName=login` with `XDG_SEAT=seat0`: logind created an active
Wayland `Class=user` session on graphical `seat0` with `VTNr=0`, Phoc remained
functional through seatd, and the Phosh Polkit agent registered for that
session. NetworkManager scan, radio and network-control authorization passed
for the real GNOME Settings PID and D-Bus name, and Wi-Fi controls worked in
the UI. This setup is now tracked by the M1 recipe but still requires
post-rebuild hardware validation; it was not present in the original v3
image. `settings.modify.system` correctly remains an administrative action.

Still open are post-rebuild validation of this session setup, administrative
system-connection editing, timezone control, UPower/battery reporting,
colored boot rectangles, power-button suspend/wake, screenshot integration,
touch/UI latency, observed Settings launch instability, and the eventual
default application set. See the v3 hardware note and
`notes/mobian-m1-phosh-logind-polkit-validation-2026-09-04.md`.

## Repository policy

Generated `.img`, `.ext4`, Android sparse images, root filesystems, private
keys, caches and other build artifacts are intentionally excluded from Git.
